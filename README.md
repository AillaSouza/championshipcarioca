Project Overview

This project analyzes the performance of the top four football teams from Rio de Janeiro over the last four years in the Campeonato Carioca. The goal is to observe and track the ranking positions of these teams throughout the years. Using data from the API-FOOTBALL, the project provides insights into team performance through the use of a pivot table for a clearer, more structured view of their rankings.

Data Cleaning Techniques Applied

Handling missing data for incomplete match records.
Ensuring consistency in team names and other categorical data.
Removing any duplicate records to maintain data integrity.
Formatting and processing date information for analysis.
Business Case

By understanding the performance trends of Rio de Janeiro's four major teams, stakeholders in the football community (such as analysts, fans, and sponsors) can identify patterns and make data-driven decisions. This analysis can be leveraged for improving team strategies, driving fan engagement, and even influencing sponsorships and merchandise sales, depending on team performance over the seasons.

Tools Used

Python: For data analysis and wrangling.
Pandas: To clean the data and build a pivot table showing the rankings of the top teams.
API-FOOTBALL: For retrieving historical match data.
Jupyter Notebook: For code execution and visualization of the analysis.
